# House Pricing Prediction

Welcome to my personal project repository for predicting house prices using linear regression! This repository is a culmination of my efforts to understand linear regression concepts, apply basic data cleaning techniques, and explore feature selection for my personal exploration and learning journey.

## Overview

Predicting house prices has always intrigued me, and this repository serves as a space where I dive into the world of data science to make sense of real estate values using linear regression.

## Key Features of My Personal Project

1. **Datasets**: I've meticulously curated datasets, ensuring they are rich, diverse, and reflective of real-world scenarios. These datasets come with their quirks and imperfections, giving me the opportunity to practice data cleaning and preprocessing.

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**: The Jupyter notebooks here are my personal notes. They contain my observations, comments, and insights gained during this project. I emphasize not just the "how" but also the "why" behind every step.

3. **Data Cleaning**: Witness my journey in handling missing data, taming outliers, and applying data cleaning techniques to get the data ready for modeling.

4. **EDA Techniques**: I explore the data using various EDA techniques, from basic statistics to creative data visualizations. My goal is to uncover those hidden gems of information that influence house prices.

5. **Model Implementation**: See how I put my cleaned and explored data to use by building linear regression models. The code is a reflection of my personal experimentation and learning.

6. **Model Evaluation**: I evaluate my models using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared (R2), learning from both successes and failures.

7. **Interactive Visualizations**: Engage with interactive visualizations in my notebooks to gain deeper insights into the relationships between features and house prices.
